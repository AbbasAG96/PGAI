          The partnership aims to help humanitarian actors overcome technical
          challenges associated with deploying sophisticated new generative AI
          models, speeding up applicational development through collaboration
          and resource sharing. Working through the partnership makes it easer
          for humanitarian actors to forge ties with generative AI players
          around humanitarian applications and around issues like trust, safety
          and security.
